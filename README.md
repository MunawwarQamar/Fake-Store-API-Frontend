## Project Description

This project represents **Part 2 of our assignment**, which focuses on **consuming RESTful APIs directly from the frontend** using modern JavaScript technologies.

We built a web application that fetches and displays product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) using **Fetch API**.

Users can:
- Browse all available products.
- Filter by category.
- Search by product name.
- View detailed product information in a modal.
- Add products to a shopping cart (with localStorage).
- View and manage their cart in a dedicated cart page.

âœ… **The project is deployed and accessible online via GitHub Pages**.
